**Medibeng-Orpheus-3b-0.1-ft** is a fine-tuned Text-to-Speech (TTS) model trained on the **MediBeng** dataset, designed to handle bilingual Bengali-English **code-switching** in healthcare settings. This model builds on the **Orpheus TTS** architecture and leverages the **LLaMA-3b** backbone. Special thanks to **Unsloth** for their contribution in accelerating the training process using **HuggingFace's TRL** library.

* **Healthcare Focus:** Tailored for use in healthcare, simulating medical dialogues between patients and doctors.
* **Accelerated Fine-Tuning:** Using **Unsloth** and **HuggingFace‚Äôs TRL**, the fine-tuning process was optimized for **2x faster** training.

## **üìä Fine-Tuning Process**

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the fine-tuning process that was followed to train the model:

| **Step**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Dataset Preparation** | Used **MediBeng**, a bilingual Bengali-English healthcare dataset, which simulates clinical dialogues.                         |
| **2. Model Architecture**  | Built on **Orpheus TTS** using **LLaMA-3b** architecture for high-quality speech synthesis.                                    |
| **3. Fine-Tuning**         | Fine-tuned using **HuggingFace‚Äôs TRL** library, supported by **Unsloth** for accelerated training.                             |
| **4. Training Duration**   | **2x faster** fine-tuning thanks to optimization techniques from **Unsloth**.                                                  |
| **5. Validation**          | Ensured the model‚Äôs ability to handle code-switching, and clinical dialogues, achieving satisfactory results in initial tests. |

## **üìã Limitations**

* **Pronunciation & Prosody:** Although the model generates high-quality speech, further fine-tuning is needed to improve pronunciation nuances and prosody, especially for diverse accents.
* **Accent Handling:** The model is focused on general code-switching and may need further tuning for region-specific accents.
* **Dataset Bias:** The **MediBeng** dataset is a limited representation of healthcare dialogues and may not cover every healthcare context or dialect.

## **üìù Use Cases**

This model is suitable for various healthcare-related applications, including:

* **Virtual Healthcare Assistants:** Bilingual assistants for seamless patient interaction.
* **Telemedicine Applications:** Assisting doctors and patients in remote consultations with bilingual dialogue generation.
* **Medical Training Simulations:** Simulating bilingual clinical interactions for medical education.
* **Bilingual Healthcare Chatbots:** Enhancing conversational agents with natural speech synthesis in both Bengali and English.

## **üìÇ Dataset**

The model was fine-tuned on the **MediBeng** dataset:

* **Content:** Contains code-switched Bengali-English synthetic dialogues, simulating real-world patient-doctor conversations.
* **Scope:** Designed to cover a variety of clinical interactions in bilingual settings.
